# YouTube Channel Analysis

This repository contains Python scripts for analyzing YouTube channel data. The primary focus is to calculate and explore the distribution of different types of YouTube channels.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you in setting up the project locally for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

To run the scripts, ensure you have the following Python packages installed:
- pymysql
- pandas
- sqlalchemy

### Installation

Clone the repository and install the necessary packages using pip:

!pip install pymysql
!pip install pandas sqlalchemy

markdown
Copy code

## Running the Scripts

The main script performs the following tasks:
1. Loads a dataset from a CSV file (`youtube_dataset.csv`).
2. Calculates the distribution of channel types within the dataset.
3. Selects and processes the top 1000 records.
4. Saves the processed data to a new CSV file (`top_1000_channels.csv`).
5. Connects to a MySQL database and uploads the data.

### Important Notes

- The script contains database connection details. Ensure to replace these with your actual database credentials.
- The dataset `youtube_dataset.csv` should be present in the same directory as the script.

## Deployment

The script is designed for a local development environment. For deployment, additional configuration may be required depending on your setup.
